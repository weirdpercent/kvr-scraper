snigulp is an audio plugin database like [KVR Audio](http://www.kvraudio.com/). This is the KVR scraper module.

* First stage works, it saves the link for each released, free product on KVR to plinks.txt.
* Second stage is in progress, scraping data for each product into JSON.

TODO:

* Write tests
* Loop stage 1 to reduce length? First attempt was unsuccessful
